# Hackathon-Spring-2019

In this code pattern, we will create and deploy a Graduate Admissions  chances of admit model using IBM Cloud Private for Data. First, we will load graduate admissions activity data into Db2 Warehouse. Next, we'll use a Jupyter notebook to visualize the data, build hypotheses for prediction, and then build, test, and save a prediction model. Finally, we will enable a web service and use the model from an app.
